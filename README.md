Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of Olympic Games data. Includes insights on athlete demographics, gender trends, event evolution, and country-wise medal statistics using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.


# 🏅 Olympic Data Analysis & Visualization

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Visualization** on the Olympic dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to athletes, events, medals, countries, and gender-based participation.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Olympic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
- **Total Rows**: ~270,000+  
- **Columns**: 15+

## 📊 Key Analysis & Visualizations

### 1. Height vs Weight of Athletes (Gender-wise)
- Visualized using `scatterplot`
- Shows body size patterns in male vs female athletes

### 2. Age Distribution of Gold Medalists
- Histogram + KDE plot
- Most gold winners are aged between 20–30

### 3. Top 10 Most Popular Sports (by Athlete Count)
- Bar chart based on unique athletes per sport
- Reveals most participated sports

### 4. Gender-wise Participation Over the Years
- Line plot showing increasing female participation over time

### 5. Top 10 Countries with Most Medals
- Horizontal bar chart
- Highlights Olympic giants like USA, Russia, Germany

### 6. Year-wise Number of Events
- Line plot indicating growth in number of Olympic events
